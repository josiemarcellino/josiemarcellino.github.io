    excerpt: >
      <p>My name is Josie and I’m so glad to have you here!</p>
      <p>My photography journey began in 2012, in my hometown of Westminster Maryland.</p>
      <p>I’ve spent over a decade traveling the world and taking on a wide variety of projects that have 
      connected me with incredible people and allowed me to capture truly magical moments. I currently reside in 
      Philadelphia though I often find myself in the bustling heart of New York City, or back amongst family in 
      Baltimore.</p>
      <p>I know being in front of the camera can be daunting. My goal is to always create a relaxing and comfortable 
      atmosphere to capture the perfect, authentic shots that tell your story. Variety is truly the spice of life; I 
      offer services for weddings, prom, Mitzvahs, engagements, professional headshots, senior portraits, maternity 
      shoots, and more.</p>
      <p>If you’re looking for a dedicated photographer, who will celebrate you, let’s chat! I can’t wait to hear from 
      you!</p>
      <p>Cheers,<br>
        Josie</p>
